Both scripts contain some of the same features but one is everything that I release the other is just a collection of trolls for those that want it.
These are just things that I want to release publicly and I hope you hate it :)
I am building this lua to be my one and only that I load eventually so I will pull the features I like from other luas but will have mostly my own work as I finish learning the game.

You have to be spectating or near players to orb them  (that is gta thing)

Added a bunch of stuff I am currently testing/have added for myself and I think finished the commenting? 12/11/21
Anything marked beta is probably broken and does not work. You have to enable trusted mode for the 500k loop to work I do not have a check for it



It probably does not work atm I edited it but did not test it so gl lol. If you message me errors and lines I can probably fix it for you if you want before I test it.



Bugs: I know it shows someone is marked as a modder for 0 health after they leave and survived netbail after you load in even if you kicked the host. 



All the SE is broken rn give me a bit I am learning how to work through the updates 12/18/21

Updated netbail, se kick, block passive, bounty, 500k loop. 12/19/21 Others are coming but I have to convert the hex to int32 and I am lazy rn so smd you fuck man
